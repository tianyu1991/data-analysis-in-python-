Some calls result in an officer being dispatched to the scene,and some log an arrival time. the difference between dispatch time and arrival time is the response time. Only valis (non-negative) times are being considered.

The median of response time is 289.0 s. The mean of response time is 496.2 s.

The response time of most of calls are 316~1000 secs.

The numbers of calls got responded within 100 secs have continuing decreased from 2011 to 2015.
